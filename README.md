# Regression Using Deep Learning Project - 020MLRES4 - Machine Learning


## Description
This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras Tuner to perform regression analysis on the Auto MPG dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of vehicles based on various attributes like Cylinders, Displacement, Horsepower, etc.

## Installation

Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To set up the project environment, run the following commands:


pip install tensorflow
pip install keras-tuner
pip install pandas
pip install numpy


## Usage

To run the notebook, navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook:


jupyter notebook


Open `projetregressionversion2.1.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially to see the results of the regression analysis.

## Project Sections

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and preparing data for analysis.
- **One Hot Encoding**: Encoding categorical variables as binary vectors.
- **Relationship Scatters**: Visualizing relationships between different variables.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Analyzing the correlation between different features.
- **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and test sets.
- **Linear Regression**: Implementing a linear regression model to predict MPG.
- **R2_score Values**: Evaluating the performance of the linear regression model.
- **DNN Using One Single Input**: Developing a deep neural network with a single input feature.
- **DNN Using Multiple Inputs**: Developing a deep neural network with multiple input features.

## Data

The dataset used is the Auto MPG dataset, which can be automatically loaded via the notebook. It includes the following attributes:
- MPG (Miles per gallon)
- Cylinders
- Displacement
- Horsepower
- Weight
- Acceleration
- Model Year
- Origin
